Here are the usernames:
1. Username: Alu1
2. Username: potol2

Now, let's analyze the task notes to see if we can find any hints for a possible username.
Based on the usernames "Alu1" and "potol2" and the task notes provided, I would suggest the following possible username:
- Username: Task3_potol2

This username combines the task identifier "Task3" with the username "potol2" to create a unique username based on the information available.
